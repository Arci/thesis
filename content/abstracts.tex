\chapter*{Abstract}
Within the last years, especially for web applications, data requirements have changed drastically. Applications needs to handle an increasing amount of information that is not always well structured. Hence solutions to handle those new kind of data have emerged over the classical DBMS solutions; the new solutions comes under the name of NoSQL to state the different approach they bring with respect to DBMS.
Many NoSQL technologies comes into play in these years and each uses a different approach  to handle the new application requirements both in terms of amount of data and scalability requirements.

\noindent To achieve those requirements, those technologies provides a set of proprietary API that does not abstract the physical structure of the stored data, this move toward the user a lot of programming effort with respect to DBMS. Recently academics and even industry started to claim for a common language that permits to the users to interacts with different NoSQL databases such that is not more necessary a deep knowledge of the specific NoSQL system to use. Furthermore the use of NoSQL, currently, locks the user to the specific technology due to the inability of porting the application code from a NoSQL database to another, which is instead possible when using DBMS, beside specific SQL dialects.

\noindent The objective of this work is to propose a model that permits to users to develop applications using the advantages of the NoSQL technology without be locked to the used technology and providing the user a common language, such as SQL, that permits the use of NoSQL databases without the necessity of learning  the complexity of the new systems.

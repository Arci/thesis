\begin{itemize}
\item why use kundera among others
\begin{itemize}	
\item open source
\item JPA standard interface
\item community
\item many supported databases
\item polyglot persistence
\item client extension framework
\item used in production
\end{itemize}
\item why include it into CPIM
\item why extend CPIM to include migration
\begin{itemize}	
\item vendor lock-in and thus costs
\item cost of offline migration (shutdown, migration, restart)
\item live data synchronization and migration
\item functionality (for map reduce job better persist over hbase)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
